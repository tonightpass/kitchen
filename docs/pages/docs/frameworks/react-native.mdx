# Getting Started with React Native

<Callout>
  This package is still in active development and is not yet ready for
  react-native projects.
</Callout>

## Installation
In your React Native or Expo project, install Kitchen by running either of the following:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @tonightpass/kitchen --save
```

## Provider Setup

After installing Kitchen, you need to set up the `KitchenProvider` at the root 
of your application. This can be either in your `App.jsx` or `App.tsx` file.

```jsx
// App.jsx
import { KitchenProvider } from "@tonightpass/kitchen/native";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <KitchenProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </KitchenProvider>
  );
}
```

In addition, here is a complete [project example](https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchen/tree/master/examples/expo-typescript) using Kitchen with Expo.
