# Default Theme

The theme object is where you define your application's color palette, font stacks, breakpoints, border radius values, and more.

Theming with Kitchn is based on our [Design Principles](/docs/guides/principles). We recommend you read through them before you start theming your application.

## Colors

Kitchn provides a sensible default theme inspired by [Tonight Pass](https://tonightpass.com/) and [Hiven](https://twitter.com/phineyes/status/1335623562892369921?s=20), but you can customize it to fit your design.

### Layout

Layout colors are used for backgrounds, borders, etc.

### Text

Text colors are used for text and icons.

### Accent

Accent colors are static colors that are used to highlight important information.

## Font

Kitchn uses [Figtree](https://fontsource.org/fonts/figtree) as the primary font. You can change this to any font you want.
