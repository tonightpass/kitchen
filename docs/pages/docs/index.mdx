Kitchn is a [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) suite of components that are designed to work together to create a beautiful and consistent UI. Inspired by [Geist](https://geist-ui.dev/) and [Vercel Design](https://vercel.com/design) with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. This library is maintained by [Tonight Pass](https://tonightpass.com).

  production use.

## Installation

Kitchn is available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonightpass/kitchn).

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @tonightpass/kitchn --save
```

After installing Kitchn, you need to set up the `KitchnProvider` at the root of your applications.
This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx
import { KitchnProvider } from "@tonightpass/kitchn";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <KitchnProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </KitchnProvider>
  );
}
```
