This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx
import { KitchenProvider } from "@tonightpass/kitchen";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <KitchenProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </KitchenProvider>
  );
}
