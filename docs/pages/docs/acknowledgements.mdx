# Acknowledgements

Kitchen was originally created by [Antoine Kingue](https://twitter.com/antoinekingue) as a closed-source enterprise software offering. In late 2022, [Tonight Pass](https://tonightpass.com) started working on Kitchen and open sourced the codebase.

Today, Kitchen has dedicated full-time team working on it as well as a growing list of [open source contributors](https://github.com/tonightpass/kitchen/graphs/contributors).
